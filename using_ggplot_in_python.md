# Using ggplot in python

Junyi Yao

I am new to R, but I like the high quality plots made by ggplot2. I used to use python packages(numpy, pandas) to process data and use seaborn to make plots. In my personal opinion, numpy and pandas are easier to use than tidyverse. However, ggplot2 makes better plots.

So I think if I could use numpy and pandas to process the data and use ggplot to make the plots, that would be very convinient. So I tried to find ways to use ggplot in python.
The package I found is "plotnine", which is essentially the python version of ggplot. So I want to make a tutorial on how to use numpy and pandas to process data and use ggplot2 to make plots as we did in Rstudio.

Here if the link to my tutorial: [Using ggplot in python](https://github.com/junyi-yao/STAT5702/blob/main/Using%20ggplot%20in%20python.pdf)
