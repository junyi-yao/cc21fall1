# Natural Langauge Processing Common EDA Practices in Python

Zhucheng Zhan, Yunchen Yao



In Natural Language Processing, exploratory data analysis is an important and essential part before training models. We could obtain adequate information from text data visualization, like getting the most frequently used word quickly to understand what the text is about, and many more.

For the community contribution, we introduce four major techniques that are commonly used to understand text data and give an example of implementing these techniques by python. We take Twitter text data as our example to illustrate the common practices for NLP EDA.
