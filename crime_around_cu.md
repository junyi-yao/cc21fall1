# Crime Analysis around Columbia

Sarthak Bhargava and Arunit Maity

## Motivation
As part of community contribution we aim to analyze the crime frequency in the districts surrounding Columbia University. As international students, we were very concerned about the safety of the locality we wished to reside in. Our project helps in identifying areas of high crime and thereby help students with house hunting as well as getting around the area near Columbia University.
