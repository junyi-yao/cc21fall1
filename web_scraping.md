# Web Scrapping using BeautifulSoup and its Equivalent in rvest

Shreya Verma and Malaika Gupta

## Motivation
While there may be multiple separate tutorials on using BeautifulSoup and rvest, it is sometimes challenging to convert code (with different functions in different languages), for instance, in Python to R and vice versa. Since most of our classmates have more experience in Python than R, which implies that they have performed web scraping in Pyhton rather than in R, this tutorial could help them directly relate between the two. This project can hopefully help our classmates understand a direct translation (so to say) of web scraping from BeautifulSoup to rvest.
